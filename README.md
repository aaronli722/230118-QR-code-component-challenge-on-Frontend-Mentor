## Overview

I studied html and css through freeCodeCamp in 2022. I tried this challenge once in Apr 2022 but since Jun, as I started my new business I totally gave up practicing. And now I get my time back but forgot almost all knowledges so I studied again and retry this challenge.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I think the main challenge is how to center the card to the center of the screen. In my first try, I just measured the height of the preview image and vertically align the card using padding, and then it failed when the viewport height changed.

This time, I have a more understanding of flex and just easily center the card by align-items and justify-content.

Besides, I studied from other resources that the root size can be set to 62.5% making it 10px, so I can easily calculate the rem.

### Continued development

After the challenge, I am still having some questions:

1. Is there a common practice of the css properties order? for example, display comes first, then width/height, and then margin/padding, etc?

2. When to use class, when to use id?

In my concept, id is use when the element is unique, for example #card in this challenge. But when I studied the html code of other pages, I found that they may also use class to describe unique element. So when to use class, when to use id?
